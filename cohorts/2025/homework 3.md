## Module 3 Homework (2025 Cohort)

In this homework, we're going to work with categorical variables, first ML models (Decision Trees), and hyperparameter tuning.

Please use the [Colab Module 3](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/stock-markets-analytics-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-modeling/%5B2025%5D_Module_3_Colab_Time_Series_Modeling.ipynb) for all tasks to ensure you have the same dataframe used for the Modeling part, as covered during the lecture. 
We suggest copying and extending it (around "TODO" comments).

**HINT**: If you want to avoid data truncation in GitHub's UI, try either of the following options:
* Open the notebook in [Colab, using the GitHub link to the notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/DataTalksClub/stock-markets-analytics-zoomcamp/blob/main/03-modeling/%5B2025%5D_Module_3_Colab_Time_Series_Modeling.ipynb).
* Clone the repository to a local folder and open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook.

### [EXPLORATORY] Question 5: What data is missing? 

Now that you have some insights from the correlation analysis and the Decision Trees regarding the most influential variables, suggest new indicators you would like to include in the dataset and explain why.

You can also propose something entirely different based on your intuition, but it should be relevant to the shared dataset of the largest Indian, EU, and US stocks. If you choose this approach, please specify the data source as well.
